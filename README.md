# Data Analysis App with Python and Streamlit

This repository contains a simple data analysis application built using Python and Streamlit. The app allows users to upload a CSV dataset and perform basic data analysis tasks such as previewing the dataset, checking data types, finding the shape of the dataset, identifying missing values, and more.

## Features

- Upload dataset (CSV format)
- Preview the dataset (head and tail)
- Check data types of each column
- Find the shape of the dataset (rows and columns)
- Identify and visualize missing values
- Detect and remove duplicate values
- Generate summary statistics of the dataset

- #Installation

Prerequisites
-Anaconda: Anaconda is a distribution of Python and R for scientific computing and data science. It comes with many useful libraries and tools pre-installed.
-Spyder IDE: Spyder is an open-source cross-platform IDE for scientific programming in Python.

Steps
1. Launch Spyder from Anaconda: Open the Anaconda Navigator and launch the Spyder IDE. Spyder comes with Anaconda, so all the required libraries (pandas, seaborn, etc.) will be readily available.
2. Run the Streamlit App:
  - Open the Anaconda Prompt from the Anaconda Navigator.
  - Navigate to the directory containing your Streamlit app.
  - Run the Streamlit app with the following command "streamlit run app.py"
3. View the App: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to view the app running locally.

bout
This app is built using Streamlit, a fast way to build and share data apps. Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.
